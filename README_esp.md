I got some messages that this email (or at least the attachment) did not get delivered...   I have renamed the file attachment to be a txt - to 'fool' the email delivery systems (hopefully!).   However, this is still a ZIP file - so you just need to re-name the extension and un-zip it to see the screens, etc.

It would be good if someone could let me know how this goes at the 'other' end...

Crawford.
